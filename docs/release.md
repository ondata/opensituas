# Release procedure

## Subrelease

Use a subrelease for a low-risk patch that does not change the release flow,
for example a bug fix, a small CLI UX correction, or a docs-only follow-up
that should ship as the next patch version.

Patch-version pattern:

- `0.1.0` -> `0.1.1`
- `1.2.3` -> `1.2.4`

Minimal subrelease workflow:

```bash
# 1. Bump only the patch version in pyproject.toml

# 2. Refresh lockfile
uv lock

# 3. Update LOG.md with the patch notes

# 4. Run linter and full test suite — both must pass before any publish step
uv run ruff check src/
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# 5. Commit and tag the patch release
git add -u
git commit -m "chore: bump version to vX.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z

# 6. Push branch and tag
git push origin main --tags

# 7. Publish the release artifacts
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "patch release notes here"
uv build
twine upload dist/opensituas-X.Y.Z*

# 8. Refresh the local CLI install
uv tool install --editable .
```

## Prerequisites

- PyPI credentials configured for `twine` (token in `~/.pypirc` or env)
- `gh` CLI authenticated

## Steps

```bash
# 1. Bump version in pyproject.toml
#    Edit version = "X.Y.Z" → "X.Y.Z+1"

# 2. Update uv.lock
uv lock

# 3. Update LOG.md with changes

# 4. Run linter and full test suite — both must pass before any publish step
uv run ruff check src/
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# 5. Commit and tag
git add -u
git commit -m "chore: bump version to vX.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z

# 6. Push with tags
git push origin main --tags

# 7. Create GitHub release
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "release notes here"

# 8. Build and publish to PyPI
uv build
twine upload dist/opensituas-X.Y.Z*

# 9. Update local CLI
uv tool install --editable .
```
